<h1>The Berning Question</h1>

<p>
  Optional student project from Udemy's 
  <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/learn/#/">The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Production version running on Heroku at <a href="https://theberningquestion.herokuapp.com/">The Berning Question</a>
</p>

<p>
  Conceived amidst the 2016 presedential race, the application provides a simple platform for "doing politics" a little differently - at least 
  in one small way of putting people in touch with a candidate they want to speak with. The intention is to allow regular folks to pose 
  honest questions asking how-will-you-actually-do-that about Bernie Sanders' talking points, voting on questions, and initiating 
  discussions. The end goal being that Bernie would actually visit at some point and answer the Top 5.
</p>

<p>
  The application could be customized to target any person the general public would like a forum with, but since Bernie gives good vibe in 
  all his rumpled honesty and big-heartedness, Bernie's app it shall be.
